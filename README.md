# ML-in-Cybersecurity
This repository contains my work for the course of "ML for Cybersecurity". It contains three mini-projects which are as follows:
1. Developing MNIST classifiers in pytorch using K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN), Support Vector Machines(SVM) and Convolutional Net=ural Networks(CNN).
2. FGSM and i-FGSM attacks on MNIST classifier and its defense.
3. Malware Detector.
